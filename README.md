# Arcane Dungeon

**Arcane Dungeon** is a 2D top-down adventure game built in Construct 3 as my final project for the *Game Development Workshop* course at Adelphi University (Spring 2024). In this game, you play as a wizard who must brave a dangerous dungeon using a set of summonable Arcane Constructs.

The player cannot interact with the world directly â€” instead, they summon magical constructs that orbit them via mouse control:

- ðŸ—¡ **Sword** â€“ Attacks enemies like slimes and the dungeon boss  
- âœ‹ **Hand** â€“ Grabs distant items to unlock doors and solve puzzles  
- ðŸ›¡ **Shield** â€“ Blocks enemy projectiles and provides defense

The game includes a short tutorial and a single dungeon with combat, puzzles, and a slime boss encounter. I focused on creating a flexible interaction system through indirect control, as well as designing intuitive movement, physics, and combat mechanics.

### Future Improvements
If I had more time, I would expand the game with multiple dungeon levels, more enemies, and deeper puzzle mechanics using the construct system.
